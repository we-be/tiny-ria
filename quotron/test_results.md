## Notes

1. All scripted tests were conducted using the Alpha Vantage API key Q3R4E9KFVLXOWEXN
2. The system can now handle the API response format variations between different data sources
3. The health monitoring system now correctly detects and reports on all data sources
4. Market data fetching from Alpha Vantage sometimes returns empty responses due to API limitations, but the system handles this gracefully
